# A11y Workshop

Welcome to the **Accessibility Workshop** repository! This project is designed to help frontend developers learn the essentials of building accessible websites and creating inclusive user experiences. Accessibility isn‚Äôt just about compliance‚Äîit‚Äôs about ensuring that everyone, regardless of ability, can use and enjoy your site.

This repository includes a sample React project built with Vite to simulate real-world scenarios. You'll explore common accessibility challenges and try to solve them, to not make the same mistakes in your own projects.

Test yourself by identifying and fixing accessibility issues in the provided project. With hands-on practice, you‚Äôll gain a deeper understanding of:

- Semantic HTML
- ARIA roles and attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Accessible animations and motion
